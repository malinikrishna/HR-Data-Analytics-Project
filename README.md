### Problem Statement

Pinali Mandalia, who works in Human Resources at AtliQ Technologies, a company specializing in data solutions, supplied genuine, anonymized attendance records of employees spanning a three-month timeframe. These records contained unique attendance identifiers. The objective is to create an interactive dashboard that can respond to inquiries related to human resources and provide meaningful analysis.


### Understanding Requirements

The initiative centered on analyzing an Excel dataset Attendance Sheet 2022-2023_Masked.xlsx provided by HR Manager Pinali, which covered employee data over three months. The main goal was to derive valuable insights from this information, such as:

  - Employees' preferred work habits, including their favored days to take leave—particularly at the start or end of the week—or to work remotely.
  - Comprehend the causes behind sick leave and to determine whether there was a need to implement additional safety protocols in the workplace.
  - Monitor patterns in employee attendance to better organize corporate gatherings such as meetings, team meals, and various events.


### Methodology

The following steps were undertaken to achieve the project objectives:

1. **Data Integration**: Imported the Excel dataset into PowerBI.
2. **Data Transformation**: Conducted ETL processes and cleaned the data using Power Query.
3. **Measure Creation**: Developed various measures according to the project needs for use in visualizations.
4. **DAX Formulas**: Utilized DAX to create additional columns to aid in data analysis.
5. **Dashboard Development**: Designed and finalized a comprehensive PowerBI dashboard that meets the specified requirements.


### Project Outcome

The outcome is an intuitive dashboard that offers transparent analysis of employee attendance patterns and work choices, assisting the Human Resources team at AtliQ Technologies in their decision-making process.
